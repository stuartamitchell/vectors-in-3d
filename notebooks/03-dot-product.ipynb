    "Numpy also provides us with a way to do the dot product of two vectors. There are actually two ways, because numpy provides a function called dot which does matrix multiplication of vectors, and also a function called vdot which does vector dot product as expected.\n",

    "As usual, we import numpy as np. I then define three vectors and compute the dot product of each possible pairing."
